# Data Structures

This repository contains **Java implementations of fundamental data structures**
covered in our university course.

Each data structure is implemented in its own **Java package**, allowing you to
study, test, and modify them independently.

The goal of this repository is to:
- Understand how data structures work internally
- Practice implementing them from scratch (without built-in collections)
- Serve as a reference for revision and learning
